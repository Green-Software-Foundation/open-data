## Scope
This Open Data project will provide all the necessary data sources that can be used as inputs for the SCI standard, for free. There may be more accurate data sources available to some users of the SCI, but this project is to create a baseline set of data to be used when this isnâ€™t possible. At least the following data sets will be published:

- (I) - Emissions factors. These may be regional yearly averages to begin, but ideally marginal and at a finer granularity than that. 
- (M) - Embodied Emissions data for servers, mobile devices and laptops 
- (E) - Energy consumption (kilowatt hours) for different components of the software boundary, over a given time period. Examples:
  - CPU/GPUs at different percentages of utilization
  - Data storage
  - Memory allocation
  - Data transferred over a network
