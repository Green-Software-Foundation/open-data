## NTT DATA - On-Premise Web system

### Overview

We calculated SCI value for a web system following 3-tier architecture.
Calculating SCI value through this case study involves measuring the behavior of components and their results based on scenarios.
We deployed TPC-W implementation proposed by Transaction Processing Performance Council as a workload.
TPC-W is designed for measuring performance and cost for performance in an environment where online transaction processing (OLTP) is set up for e-commerce.
In areas where it is difficult to measure, it is estimated by publication from trusted institutions.
We assume life span of this system is 4 years, then M is divided by 35040 [hours] (4 [years] * 365 [days] * 24 [hours])
