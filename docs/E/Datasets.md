# Public Datasets for Energy Calculation

### What public sources and references are available for energy estimates for computing resourcesâ€‹?
Here are some sources and references you can use for estimating the energy of computing resources:

1. [Cloud Jewels coefficients](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/cloud-jewels-estimating-kwh-in-the-cloud/)
The following coefficients are provided by Cloud Jewels for how many watt-hours (Wh) it takes to run a virtual server and to store a terabyte of data on HDD (hard disk drive) or SSD (solid-state drive) disks in a cloud computing environment:
- 2.10 Wh per vCPUh for Server
- 0.89 Wh/TBh for HDD storage 
- 1.52 Wh/TBh for SSD storage 
2. [Avg Watts - Active Idle time for servers](https://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/results/power_ssj2008.html)
