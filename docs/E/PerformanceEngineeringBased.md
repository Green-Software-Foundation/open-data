# Performance Engineering Based techniques

## What is the process of calculating Energy using the Performance Engineering Technique?

The main consumers of power on a server will be the CPU, the GPU, and the memory. Estimating how much each consumes will give you an estimate of how much power your server, or your application on a server, consumes. We consider energy spent to be directly proportional to Power as E= P*t 



## In the Performance engineering technique, what is the formula that can be used for the overall energy calculation of the server?


The formula is as follows:

`P[kWh]=(c∙P_c+ P_r+g∙P_g)/1000`

Where c is the number of cores , P_c the power consumption of the CPU, P_g is the power consumption of the GPU ,g is the number of Memory sticks, P_r is the power consumption of the memory.

## What is the dataset that can can be used for calculation of E through Performance Engineering Technique?
