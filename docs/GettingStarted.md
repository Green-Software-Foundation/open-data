calculation guidelines for emobodied emissions.

Please note the data provided by the data providers are approximation based and the intent is to help calculate the SCI score. Once the SCI score is calculated, you can apply reduction principles across releases, to reduce the SCI score and the carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency for your software application.
