# API Based


### How we can get carbon itensity through the API based technique?

 â€‹The API-based technique is one of the simplest options to get carbon intensity based on the location/geography where your application is hosted and running. Providers like (WattTime API)[https://www.watttime.org/] and (ElectricityMap)[https://app.electricitymaps.com/map] provide an API to get the carbon intensity based on location parameters.

The WattTime API provides access to real-time, forecast and historical marginal emissions data for electric grids around the world. The (API documentation)[https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/#grid-emissions-data] shows how to get grid emission data based on location.

Electricity Map provides actionable data quantifying how carbon intensive electricity is on an hourly basis across 50+ countries. You can find more detail in the (API documentation)[https://static.electricitymaps.com/api/docs/index.html].
