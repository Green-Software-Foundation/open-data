# API Based


### How we can get carbon itensity through the API based technique?

 The API-based technique is one of the simplest options to get carbon intensity based on the location/geography where your application is hosted and running. We have providers like WattTime API - https://www.watttime.org/ and ElectricityMap - https://app.electricitymaps.com/map that provides API to get the
 carbon intensity based on location parameters.

The WattTime API provides access to real-time, forecast, and historical marginal emissions data for electric grids around the world. Please refer to API documentation - https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/#grid-emissions-data on how to get grdi emission data based on location.

Electricty Mao provides actionable data quantifying how carbon intensive electricity is on an hourly basis across 50+ countries. Please refer to API documentation - https://static.electricitymaps.com/api/docs/index.html for more details.
