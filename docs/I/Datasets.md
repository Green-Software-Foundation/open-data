### What external data sources are available for getting carbon intensity data?â€‹

Here are some public sources where you can find carbon intensity data based on location: 
1. [Carbon intensity of electricit](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/carbon-intensity-electricity)
2. [Carbon Intensity for UK regions](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/)

The prefered option is to use [API-based techniques](https://sci-data.greensoftware.foundation/I/APIBased) but the above sources provide a quick reference to get average data for carbon intensity for the SCI calculation.
