### What are the steps to get embodied carbon for server/hardware resources?â€‹

FFollow these steps to get embodied carbon for server/hardware resources:

1. Find out the server/node details (processor type, CPU) running your application
2. Identify the underlying hardware configuration based on these server/node details
3. Find an identical bare metal server based on the identified hardware configuration (you can look up sources like [spec.org](https://www.spec.org/) to find a match)
