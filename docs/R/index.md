# Functional Unit

The functional unit defines how your application scales. For instance, if your application scales by APIs then choose API as your functional unit.

For instance, if you are running on the cloud, you can get the Total API request/second from the cloud metrics of your API gateway. You can get the data from a production instance or carry out a Lab based testing (i.e stress testing) to get how much CO2e is emitted per unit of the functional unit.
