## Summary

SCI = ([E](./E) * [I](./I)) + [M](./M) per [R](./R) 


This Open Data project will provide all the necessary data sources that can be used as inputs for the SCI standard. Although there may be more accurate data sources available, this project aims to create a baseline set of data to be used when more accurate data isnâ€™t available. The following data sets will be published:

- (E) - Energy consumption (kilowatt hours) for different components of the software boundary over a given time period. Examples:
  - CPU/GPUs at different percentages of utilisation
  - Data storage
  - Memory allocation
  - Data transferred over a network
- (I) - Emissions factors. These may be regional yearly averages to begin with, but should ideally be marginal, and more granular than that.
- (M) - Embodied emissions data for servers, mobile devices and laptops
